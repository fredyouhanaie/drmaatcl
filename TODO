These are not likely to be carried out since the DRMAAv2 spec is out
and all efforts will be focused on the new version.

* Attribute names
	Provide the symbolic attribute names, instead of having to use
	the actual name. For example in Tcl scripts, instead of using
	"drmaa_remote_command", "$drmaa::DRMAA_REMOTE_COMMAND" should
	be used. This would require additional table definitions in
	drmaatcl-data.w.

* Drmaa_get_attribute_names / Drmaa_get_vector_attribute_names
	* check for errors when iterating over attribute list
		* SUCCESS - continue iterating
		* NO_MORE_ELEMENTS - stop
		* anything else - report error
	* compare the number of attributes from the iteration with
	  drmaa_get_num_*
