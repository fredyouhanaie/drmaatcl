This directory contains the figure and icons for the documentation.

overview-1.fig is an xfig file, the corresponding pdf and eps files
were created manually using fig2dev, see the Makefile. At some point
the fig may be converted to pgf/TikZ.

The by-sa* files are the Creative Commons icons. The eps files were
downloaded from the CC web site. The corresponding pdf files were created
using pstopdf.

These are not part of the cmake based build system.
